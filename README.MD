# Customer Banking System 

#Overview
This is a customer banking system for users to calculate and track interest on savings and CD accounts. Users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned and view updated balaces after a certain number of months.

#This system uses four different files in its operation
>*Account.py:* The Account class is within this file containing basic account capabilities such as setting balance and interest.
>*savings_account.py:* Implements the SavingsAccount class, from Account, which is able to create a savings account and calculate interest.
>*cd_account.py:* Implements the CDAccount class from Account, which is able to create a CD (Certificate of Deposit) account and calculate its interest.
>*customer_banking.py:* This interacts with the user, enabling the ability to create savings and CD accounts, calculate interest, and display account bank information such as account balance.

#Running the System
